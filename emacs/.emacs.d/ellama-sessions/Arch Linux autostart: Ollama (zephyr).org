how to autostart ollama on boot in arch linux

** Ellama:
To automatically start Ollama (an AI-powered language learning platform) at system startup on Arch
Linux, follow these steps:

1. First, ensure that Ollama is installed by running the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   sudo pacman -S ollama
#+END_SRC

2. Next, create a new systemd service file for Ollama using your preferred text editor, such as
~nano~ or ~vim~. For example, you could call this file ~ollama.service~. Here's an example of what
the content should look like:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   [Unit]
   Description=Ollama Language Learning Platform

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/ollama start
   Restart=always
   User=your_user
   Group=your_group
   Environment="DISPLAY=:0"
   WorkingDirectory=/home/your_user

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
#+END_SRC

   In this example, replace ~your/user~ and ~your/group~ with your actual user and group names,
   respectively. The ~Environment="DISPLAY=:0"~ line is necessary if you're running Ollama in a GUI
   environment like X11 or Wayland. The ~WorkingDirectory~ parameter should be set to the directory
   where you want Ollama to run from.

3. Once you've created this file, enable the new service by running:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   sudo systemctl enable ollama.service
#+END_SRC

4. Finally, start the new service by running:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   sudo systemctl start ollama.service
#+END_SRC

5. You can now verify that Ollama is starting at boot by rebooting your machine and checking the
system logs using ~journalctl -xe~. If everything is working correctly, you should see output
related to Ollama starting up when the system starts up.

That's it! By following these steps, you should now have successfully configured Ollama to start
automatically at boot on Arch Linux.
