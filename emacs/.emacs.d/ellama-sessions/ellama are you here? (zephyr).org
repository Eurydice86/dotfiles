are you here?

** Ellama:
I'm not capable of being physically present or having a physical location. I exist solely as a
virtual entity, designed to help answer questions and provide information through text-based
communication. So, in short, I am not here in the traditional sense that you might be thinking
of. If you're asking if this conversation is taking place on a website or platform where I'm hosted,
then the answer is yes - I'm responding to your message right now!
