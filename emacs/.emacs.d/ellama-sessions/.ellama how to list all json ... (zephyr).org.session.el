Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import os
import glob

# Set the path to the directory containing JSON files
directory = '/path/to/json/directory/'

# Get all the JSON files in the given directory and its subdirectories
json_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(directory, '*.json'))

# Print the list of JSON files found
for file in json_files:
    print(file)
```

Replace `'/path/to/json/directory/'` with the actual path to your directory containing JSON files. The above code will search for all files with a `.json` extension within the specified directory and print their filenames. You can modify the `glob.glob()` pattern as per your requirement." nil) #s(llm-chat-prompt-interaction user "how can I set up a notification system that reads a list of datetimes from a text file and plays a sound at those datetimes?" nil) #s(llm-chat-prompt-interaction assistant "To set up a notification system that reads a list of dates and times from a text file and plays a sound at those specified times, you can use the `schedule` module in Python to schedule tasks based on cron-like expressions. Here's an example code snippet:

First, let's create a list of dates and times as strings, separated by whitespace. This list will be read from a text file.

```python
import time
import os
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from schedule import Scheduler, EVERYDAY, MINUTE

# Define the path to your date-time text file
date_file = 'path/to/dates.txt'

# Set up a list of dates and times (in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format)
dates = []
with open(date_file, 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        # Remove trailing whitespace and split the string into date and time parts
        date_time = line.strip()
        dt_parts = date_time.split(' ')

        # Convert the date and time parts to datetime objects
        date = datetime(*map(int, dt_parts[0].split('-')))
        time = datetime(*map(int, dt_parts[1].split(':')))
        
        # Schedule a task for this date and time
        scheduler.every().day(timedelta(hours=time.hour, minutes=time.minute)).at(date).do(play_sound)

        # Add the original string to our list of dates
        dates.append(date_time)

# Initialize the scheduler object and run it continuously in a loop
scheduler = Scheduler()
while True:
    # Run pending tasks
    try:
        scheduler.run(once=False)
    except Exception as e:
        print(\"Error:\", e)
        
    # Wait for the next second before running again
    time.sleep(1)
```

Replace `'path/to/dates.txt'` with the actual path to your text file containing dates and times in the required format. In this code, we read the list of dates from the file, convert them into datetime objects, and schedule tasks for each date-time using the `schedule` module. The notification is implemented as a separate function `play_sound()`, which you can replace with your preferred sound playback mechanism.

The scheduler runs continuously in a loop using the `while True:` statement, waiting for the next second before running again. This ensures that scheduled tasks are executed on time. Note that the scheduler is not restarted after an error occurs, so you'll need to manually restart it if any errors occur. You might want to add a function `shutdown()` to handle such scenarios and close down gracefully." nil)) nil nil nil nil nil) nil)
