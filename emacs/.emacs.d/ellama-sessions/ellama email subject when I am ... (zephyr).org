Subject: Request for Job Search Assistance from [Acquaintance's Name]

Dear [Acquaintance's Name],

I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. I am reaching out to you today because
I have been struggling with my job search, and I was wondering if I could seek your assistance.

As you may recall, we first met at [Event/Networking Function]. Since then, I have come to admire
your professional achievements and expertise in the field. With this in mind, I believe that your
insights, recommendations, and connections could greatly benefit me as I navigate through my job
search.

To provide a little background, I am currently seeking employment opportunities in the
[Industry/Field]. My skills and qualifications include [List of Key Skills and Qualifications]. I am
particularly interested in positions that require [Specific Job Responsibilities], as these align
with my professional goals and aspirations.

I would be immensely grateful if you could offer any advice, leads or job opportunities in your
network, which may suit my profile. Please let me know whether it would be more convenient to
schedule a call or meet in person at your convenience. I am also available for an interview at your
preferred time and location.

Thank you so much for considering my request, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon. If
you have any questions or require further details, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
