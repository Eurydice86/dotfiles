1. First, ensure that Ollama is installed by running the following command:

   ```sh
   sudo pacman -S ollama
   ```

2. Next, create a new systemd service file for Ollama using your preferred text editor, such as `nano` or `vim`. For example, you could call this file `ollama.service`. Here's an example of what the content should look like:

   ```sh
   [Unit]
   Description=Ollama Language Learning Platform

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/ollama start
   Restart=always
   User=your_user
   Group=your_group
   Environment=\"DISPLAY=:0\"
   WorkingDirectory=/home/your_user

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   In this example, replace `your_user` and `your_group` with your actual user and group names, respectively. The `Environment=\"DISPLAY=:0\"` line is necessary if you're running Ollama in a GUI environment like X11 or Wayland. The `WorkingDirectory` parameter should be set to the directory where you want Ollama to run from.

3. Once you've created this file, enable the new service by running:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl enable ollama.service
   ```

4. Finally, start the new service by running:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl start ollama.service
   ```

5. You can now verify that Ollama is starting at boot by rebooting your machine and checking the system logs using `journalctl -xe`. If everything is working correctly, you should see output related to Ollama starting up when the system starts up.

That's it! By following these steps, you should now have successfully configured Ollama to start automatically at boot on Arch Linux." nil)) nil nil nil nil (("num_ctx" . 8192))) nil)
