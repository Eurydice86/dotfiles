As the blood of the stars fills the ocean
And Nasha'ala beckons maternally
It is now that our fate's set in motion
and the Lips of Urhan speak eternally

Driven by our unyielding devotion
We are destined to conquer primality
As we're led to the Source of Emotion
We're ascending beyond our reality

---

Overlooked by (Written out of?) the (their?) godly narration
In the depths is a hidden atrocity
Where a grim parasitic relation
Sows the seed of our righteous ferocity

Cursed to live in the heart of creation
We abandon embracing futility
We shall dive in the depths of salvation
Rising up, overcoming (overthrowing?) divinity
