In the dark I find the way
And the blackness goes away
A glow
Aglow
Merging after and before
An inaudible uproar
A dawn
Held on
And I draw the newborn lights (like) constellations in the void


In the skies their light they shed
And the earth is scorching red
Explodes
Erodes
In harmonious embrace
As they leave their hiding place
In trance
A dance
Between the discipline of chaos and the ordered disarray
